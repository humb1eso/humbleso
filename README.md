All texture grayscale images are collected from the internet and are not original. All image pixels are set to 192 * 192, with grayscale values ranging from 0-255, which can be used for texture height mapping of 3D models, making it convenient for 3D printing testing.
This image dataset was used for my academic paper experimental testing, from texture images to 3D models for conversion to 3D printing effect testing, and the results were good.
所有纹理灰度图像的原始图像来源于互联网，不是我原创的。所有图像像素经过统一预处理设置为192*192，灰度值范围为0-255，可用于3D模型的纹理高度映射，便于3D打印测试。
该图像数据集用于我的学术论文实验测试，从纹理图像到3D模型的转换到3D打印效果测试，结果良好。
